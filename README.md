You can use only assembly and Irvine's libraries. Complexity does not have to be high, even if it is appreciated.

The class votes on projects. Top demos get significant bonus points. Upload sources. Colleagues will peer-review anonymously for plagiarism. Plagiarism is addressed according to the FIT standard procedures (0 in assignment,...).

- originality (3 points)

- complexity (1 point)
